# App Flow Document for Nexus CMMS

## Onboarding and Sign-In/Sign-Up
A new user arrives at the Nexus CMMS through a public landing page or a direct link provided by the administrator. On this landing page, the user can click on the “Sign Up” button to begin the registration process. They are taken to a sign-up form where they provide their name, email address, and a secure password. After submitting the form, the user receives a confirmation email with a verification link. Once they verify their email, they can log in for the first time. If a user forgets their password, they can click on the “Forgot Password” link on the sign-in screen. They then enter their registered email address and receive a reset link. The reset link leads them to a page where they set a new password. Social logins are not supported in this version. Signing out is available at any time by clicking on the user avatar in the header and selecting “Log Out,” which clears the session and returns the user to the public landing page.

## Main Dashboard or Home Page
After logging in, the user lands on the main dashboard. The top of the screen features a header that shows the application logo on the left and the user avatar on the right. A collapsible sidebar on the left lists the main modules: Dashboard, Master Data, Tickets, Reporting, and Settings. The central area of the dashboard displays a live ticket map at the top, showing all active tickets with color-coded markers. Below the map, widgets show quick statistics such as total open tickets, overdue service requests, and upcoming preventive maintenance tasks. A navigation bar allows the user to switch between different dashboard views, such as Executive, Operational, and Performance dashboards. Clicking any module in the sidebar loads its corresponding page, keeping the header and sidebar intact for consistent navigation.

## Detailed Feature Flows and Page Transitions
Within the Master Data module, the user first sees a list of locations or assets in a table. Above the table, a button labeled “Create New” opens a full-screen form to add a new record. The form uses standard input fields and a small Leaflet map component where the user can drop a pin to set the GPS coordinates for a location. After saving, the new record appears in the table, and the user is returned to the Master Data list. In the Ticketing module, the user sees a filterable list of tickets. Selecting “New Ticket” opens a wizard that collects ticket details, assigns a location and asset, and displays a GPS verification map. The wizard uses a dynamic form builder powered by JSON definitions that present the right checklist fields based on ticket type. Submitting the form creates the ticket and navigates back to the ticket list, with the new ticket highlighted. Clicking on any ticket in the list opens the ticket detail view, showing metadata, the location map, the dynamic checklist in read-only mode, and the history of updates. From here, a supervisor can approve or reassign tickets. At ticket closure, the user can generate a PDF jobcard by clicking “Export PDF,” which triggers the PDF generation engine and downloads the file. In the Reporting module, the user clicks on a report name to view a full-screen chart powered by the chart component library. Supervisors access the Smart Dispatch map under a special submenu in Tickets; this map shows real-time technician locations and open tickets, and it supports drag-and-drop to assign jobs. The application automatically preserves state when navigating between maps, lists, and details, ensuring a smooth transition back and forth.

## Settings and Account Management
The Settings module is accessible from the sidebar. When the user opens Settings, they see tabs for Profile, Notifications, and Roles (for administrators). In the Profile tab, users update their name, contact details, and password. The Notifications tab allows them to toggle email or in-app alerts for events such as new ticket assignments or SLA breaches. Administrators see an additional Roles tab where they can manage user roles and permissions in a table or form interface. After saving any changes, the user clicks “Back to Dashboard” in the header to return to the main workflow.

## Error States and Alternate Paths
If the user enters invalid credentials during login, an inline error message appears below the input fields prompting them to retry or reset the password. On sign-up, if the email is already registered, a clear message tells the user to log in or reset their password. When filling any form, missing required fields trigger red validation messages next to each field. If the network connection drops while the user is working offline, a banner appears at the top of the screen indicating offline mode. The PWA feature caches the last viewed data, allowing read access and form completion. Once connectivity returns, the user sees a prompt to sync changes and can resume normal operation. Attempting to access a restricted page leads to an “Access Denied” page with a link back to the dashboard.

## Conclusion and Overall App Journey
A typical user begins by signing up and verifying their email, then logs in toland on a dashboard rich with real-time insights. They navigate to Master Data to set up locations and assets, then create and manage tickets in the Ticketing module, making use of dynamic forms and integrated maps. Supervisors leverage the Smart Dispatch map for optimized assignments and generate PDF jobcards at ticket closure. In Reporting, users monitor KPIs through charts and analytics. All the while, users can personalize their experience in Settings and easily handle errors or work offline. This seamless journey from sign-up to everyday operations ensures that technicians and managers alike have a consistent, secure, and efficient experience managing IT device services within the Nexus CMMS platform.
